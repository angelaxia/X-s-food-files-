Greetings! I'm Angela Xia, author and eponymous 'X' of 'Food Blog X.'

As its name suggests, 'Food Blog X' is a blog about food (though I doubt it is only the tenth blog of its kind). It features images, recipes, and the occasional gastro-panegyric (_PEACHES! PEACHES! NE'ER A SOUR BITE! PEACHES! PEACHES! EAT ALL THAT ARE IN SIGHT!_), as well as reflections on the ethics and politics of daily life.

When I'm not cooking, reading, or eating, I am working toward a PhD in religious studies at the University of Pennsylvania. You can read more about my academic work [here] (https://rels.sas.upenn.edu/people/angela-xia).
